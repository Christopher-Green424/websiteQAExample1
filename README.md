# Millerton Lake Natural Photography Club

Arlene is a hobbyist photographer that is trying to organize a club for people to share her hobby, centered around a local lake, so that it's easily accessible to beginners. Her daughter volunteered designed this website to try to gather volunteers to help her make this idea a reality.

She has asked us to test the website, because her daughter doesn't have much experience with website creation and needs help. Arlene knows the website isn't mobile friendly, and has plans in the future to redesign it with that in mind, or get a separate mobile friendly website that would be accessed when someone opens the link from a Google Search, for instance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The website should comply with WCAG 2.0 AA ADA standards.
2. The website has a consistent theme between pages.
3. The website has at least 5 bordered images on it.
4. The website has a contact page with a form and Google Maps embed.
5. All resources used in the creation of the website are correctly cited and available for use.

## Testing Information

#### Testing on mobile devices is outside of the scope of this website, as it is. There's no need to spend time on that if you don't want to just see how it looks.

1. Go to the website: [Millerton Lake Natural Photography Club](https://christopher-green424.github.io/websiteQAExample1/)
2. Find a total of three bugs or enhancements that you have found while observing the website.
3. List them in the issues section using the GitHub issue template, styling it however you like with markdown.
4. Label the issues appropriately; either bug or enhancement and a priority level. Remember enhancements are always low priority.
5. Assign the ticket to Chris.
