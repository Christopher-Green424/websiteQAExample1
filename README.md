# Millerton Lake Natural Photography Club

Arlene is a hobbyist photographer that is trying to organize a club for people to share her hobby, centered around a local lake, so that it's easily accessible to beginners. She designed this website to try to gather volunteers to help her make this idea a reality.

She has asked us to test her website, but acknowledges that she doesn't have a lot of experience with it. She knows the website isn't mobile friendly, and has plans in the future to redesign it with that in mind, or make a separate mobile friendly website that would be accessed when someone opens the link from a Google Search, for instance.

##Acceptance Criteria
1. The website should be easy to read and navigable to all desktop users.
2. All resources used in the creation of the website are correctly cited and available for use.

##Testing Information

1. Testing on mobile devices is outside of the scope of this website, as it is. No need to spend time on that if you don't want to test it.
2. Find a total of three bugs or enhancements that you have found while observing the website.
