# Millerton Lake Natural Photography Club

Arlene is a hobbyist photographer that is trying to organize a club for people to share her hobby, centered around a local lake, so that it's easily accessible to beginners. Her daughter has helped her design this website to try to gather volunteers to make this idea a reality.

She has asked us to test the website, because her daughter doesn't have much experience with website creation and needs help. Arlene knows the website isn't mobile friendly, and has plans in the future to redesign it with that in mind, or get a separate mobile friendly website that would be accessed when someone opens the link from a Google Search, for instance.

## Important Notes

* Testing on mobile devices is outside of the scope of this website, as it is. There's no need to spend time observing the website on mobile devices unless you are curious about how it looks.

* The social media links don't lead to websites. If an alert opens notifying you that the link is a "fake social media link", assume that it is working as intended.
